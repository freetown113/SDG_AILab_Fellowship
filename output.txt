But the fact that young people are still working represents continuity with the past"" (Paulgaard 2002: 102). When Paulgaard refers to continuity with traditions, she refers to the expectations of young adults to participate in adult culture, thus these fishing villages traditionally have no actual youth culture.

Returns to education are also found to be an important role in explaining the rise in earnings inequality (see Autor, 2014). In these countries, however, the magnitude of the contribution is quite small. Two types of explanation are commonly proposed in the literature. The first emphasises relative supply and demand for skills: characteristics in lower (net) supply get higher rewards. The second, emphasises the role played by labour market institutions such as minimum wages, the degree of unionisation and the rules governing wage bargaining.

Some commentators query whether the international reaction to 9/11 might have relaxed or transformed well-established legal principles, particularly in the fields of recourse to force and state responsibility. Other scholars opine that international law is adequately suited to address the relatively new and polymorphous threats of terrorism. Regardless of one's stance on the question, it is clear that the current war on terror has generated considerable academic writing, both inside and outside of law, and propelled various legal issues, such as the application of international human rights, international humanitarian law and international criminal law, to the forefront of scholarly inquiry.

We propose a novel approach to a social science application using artificial intelligence, by suggesting a neural network designto anticipate or predict people’s perceptions regarding the Cyprus conflict and the peace mediation process.Our novel model is based on associating people’s views and thoughts on critical issues related to the conflict together with their anticipation for securing a peace treaty by year 2020. Our database is our own and has been collected through completed surveys by the international relations department students at the Near East University. The obtained digitally-coded values of the entire database as well as the proposed associative neural predicting model can be further used in training and testing the neural model, which certainly waives the way for further research in this rare application area for artificial intelligence.

For example, rural dwellers represent 43% of the population but only 32% of hospital attendances. In the absence of additional information, it not possible to determine whether or not this difference signals disparities in access for rural populations, and if so, whether the drivers are geographic, cultural or infrastructural. No data appear to be collected on access to care from the patient perspective, which would aid in understanding the nature of (and remedies for) barriers to access. Overall, it is not possible to determine with the available data whether patient income or socio-economic characteristics play a role in reaching the hospital gates or being admitted. Uneven access probably also stems from the inability of facilities across regions to provide the same services.

Based upon a content analysis of a number of key policy documents from distinct eras, it identifies definitions and understandings of social mobility within them, exploring how such references have changed over time, and critiquing the differences between the imagined ideals of what policy rhetoric seeks to do and the reality of policy implementation. In particular, it considers the characterisation of social mobility as an individualised concern, it positions aspirations of improving social mobility within the market of Higher Education, and it ultimately asks whether Higher Education can solve the government's social mobility problem.

The shift in preferences towards redistribution in the BRICS shown in Figure 4.12 is in line with similar findings for OECD countries (OECD, forthcoming). Only in a few OECD countries has no change been found since the late 1980s. Of course, the view that “incomes should be made more (or less) equal” says little about the preferred method for achieving such a change. How these attitudes towards inequality translate into concrete government policy, such as tax and transfer schemes or public service provision, is an important part of the social contract in every country.

This can amount to over 70 per cent of the total death toll. Some of this arises from the destruction of basic service infrastructure and the disruption of services, when staff, if they can get about, discover vital elements of services which may be damaged or destroyed beyond effective operational use and cannot be fixed.

Recent studies from younger democracies, however, suggest that partisanship may be more malleable in these contexts. In this paper we develop hypotheses about how political corruption might affect voter attachment to the parties of corrupt officials or to the party system as a whole. Using data from an original survey experiment in Brazil, we show that prompts about political corruption shift patterns of partisan attachment for highly educated respondents – specifically, that corruption associated with one political party reduces nonpartisanship and significantly increases identification with other political parties. In contrast, we find that information on corruption has no consistent measurable effect on partisanship for less educated respondents. We conclude by discussing the implications of malleable partisanship for democratic accountability.

In many instances however, this distinction has been used to show differences between the two settlement patterns, and consistently has overlooked their interlinkages, complementarities and synergies.111' This has been against recorded historical development trends which have shown that, urban-rural linkages include important flows of people, natural resources, capital, goods, ecosystem services, information, technology, ideas and innovation. These are important drivers of economic activities and contribute significantly to overall poverty reduction in a region.*1""This illustrates interdependent, intertwined and complementary functional and productive settlement systems. Strong linkages among urban, rural, peri-urban and other settlements enhance sustainable development, because they channel resources to where they have the largest net economic and social benefits."

Groundwater is also featured in the reviews of water reforms at the country level (e.g. Fuentes, 2011, OECD, 2013b). All these reports include sections, sub-sections, paragraphs, or illustrations that relate to groundwater, but they do not convey policy conclusions specifically geared towards the managers of specific types of groundwater, especially in the context of agriculture. First, a consistent observation is that groundwater is generally under-studied and there is a need for more in-depth assessment of groundwater stocks, use, and management practices.

Noting certain theoretical and conceptual lacunae that arise in this context, the article suggests the most appropriate solution for the assessment of the substantive-procedural relationship from the perspective of legal theory and the European Court of Human Rights' case-law. It submits, in particular, that it is always necessary to examine both aspects-substantive and procedural-of the same right and that the procedural aspect should be given primacy both in terms of the order of examination and inferences to be drawn on the question of observance of human rights by states.

Alternatively, a land use authority can also decide to organise more open and participatory forms of engagement to obtain some of the inhabitants and users’ opinions through such practices as citizen conferences, focus groups, opinion polls, public meetings and information leaflets. This latter path has the potential to achieve a consensus among a full set of stakeholders, but it is much harder to organise, and there is always the possibility that no mutually agreeable resolution will emerge.

The 1992 National Water Law has gradually transferred water resource responsibilities to 13 river basin organisations, which operate as CONAGUA implementing agencies. While some progress has been achieved in better managing interdependencies across stakeholders and creating an overarching framework for water resources management, much remains to be done to overcome the scattered regulatory framework for water services. Irrigation units typically operate without a legal identity and are not organised to voice their concerns.

One possible explanation for this is that increases in income levels are transmitted to the poor segment of the population in the region in a disproportionate (or unequal) manner. These results are similar to those obtained by Franga (2010). This analysis is presented in the following sections.

Traditional Medicine (hereafter, TM) has long been included under the vast umbrella of ICH, yet there have been few attempts to explore that relationship. This paper examines the practical implications of applying the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Heritage to TM, alongside the relationship of traditional medicine to the fields of human rights, public health and development. It considers, and reaches the conclusion that the cultural significance of traditional medicine combined with the fundamental principles of the Convention render the Convention significant in safeguarding traditional medicine for the future.

If the presence of investment funds in the sector were to expand, it could produce a business model in which ownership of the assets (by the investment funds) is separated from their management ( in the hands of the electricity firms), in a system similar to that operated by some hotel groups. In that year, it purchased 38% of EDENOR, one of the leading energy distributors in Argentina. Later it increased its interests in this country with other transmission and generating companies.

orig_57: This paper analyzes the impact of bureaucratic decision costs on agency expertise. The analysis shows that the effect of the cost associated with adopting a new regulation (the enactment cost) on agency expertise depends on what the agency would do if it remains uninformed. If an uninformed agency would regulate, increasing enactment costs increases agency expertise, if an uninformed agency would retain the status quo, increasing enactment costs decreases agency expertise. These results may influence the behavior of an uninformed overseer, such as a court or legislature, that can manipulate the agency's enactment costs. Such an overseer must balance its interest in influencing agency policy preferences against its interest in increasing agency expertise. The paper explores the implications of these results for various topics in institutional design, including judicial and executive review of regulations, structure-and-process theories of congressional oversight, national security, criminal procedure, and constitutional law.

One indication of the recognition of the important role of teachers in this context is Alberta’s inclusion of additional questions in the 2018 OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey pertaining to teachers’ and school leaders’ understanding of issues related to Indigenous cultures, history and working with Indigenous students, as well as on relevant professional development. The holistic approach of Indigenous peoples stresses how much these contribute to the overall well-being of children, as well as everyone else, in addition to factors such as material advantage and disadvantage. The trauma suffered by Indigenous peoples, including through the residential school system, is still acutely felt by many. Indeed, we were told that the symptoms of trauma may be increasing rather than diminishing with the passage of time, exacerbated through intergenerational relationships. Against this bigger picture, specific surveys of particular provinces and territories, and comparing Indigenous and non-Indigenous young people, can be better understood (Freeman, King and Pickett, 2016).

Living in a less densely populated area, for example, has little impact on children’s risks of domain deprivation (with the exception of Germany) and even predicts a lower probability of deprivation in the environment domain. Nevertheless, a child living in an intermediate or thinly populated area in either France or the UK faces higher odds of experiencing cumulative deprivation.

The aim of the study was to assess the level of responsibility of these providers towards reporting violence, especially domestic violence, and potential related legal and ethical implications. The Brazilian legislation and ethics code of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing and Psychology were studied. Legal sanctions are found in the Criminal Law of Misdemeanor Offenses, the Child and Adolescent Statute, the Elderly Statute and in the law establishing mandatory reporting of violence against women. There are also penalties in all ethics codes reviewed. It is concluded that health providers have the legal duty of reporting known domestic violence cases and they can even be charged with omission.

Similarly, available national accounts and employment data typically group together energy-related utilities — electricity and gas — and water supply, with no further breakdown. In households where both women and men are engaged in wood collection, the gender distribution of time savings may also differ significantly from that of time allocation: even if women spend more time than men collecting wood, a greater share of the time savings may accrue to men. This should be achieved through both centralized and decentralized energy technologies and systems, combining the three general models of grid extension, mini-grid access and off-grid access (AGECC, 2010).

The  Update  published content that constituted a martial theology pitting the SPLA against the National Islamic Front, the party of the Muslim Brothers under Hassan Turabi’s leadership. It interpreted events using biblical and ancient Israelite templates, placed circumstances in a narrative trajectory, and transformed political history into a spiritual chronicle. In so doing, it attracted readers beyond the geographic borders of Sudan, situating Christian Sudan in a contemporary global Sudanese diaspora while also reaching into the ancient past to locate the contemporary struggles of Sudanese Christians in an older story of divine chosenness.

Selling the surplus power increases efficiency and resilience of the power plant portfolio, and provides an incentive for the private sector to invest in renewable power plants. Local grid operators and integrated utilities may benefit from more efficient grid operation and decreasing demand for traditional generation assets and power transport infrastructure. However, the shift to a decentralised grid also represents tremendous disruption to traditional power and utility business models (as well as to power grids themselves which were designed to distribute power from generation to consumer, not from consumer to consumer) and requires increased awareness and knowledge on the part of consumers (Steinberger et al.,

Water and sanitation access, demand, provision, priority, health, organization and policy are gendered, even if this is manifested in different ways in different places. The gendered dimensions of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector are increasingly reflected in public policy agendas, but concrete results have been partial and uneven. Water was generally thought of as a physical resource whose provision was determined, for the most part, by the hydrological cycle and physical infrastructure.

However, in 2015 and again in 2016 both rates rose, representing a setback that was especially severe in the case of extreme poverty. In turn, the extreme poverty rate will likely remain at the same level as in 2017, which would push up the numbers living in this situation by around 1 million. A range of procedures and assumptions are adopted for these measurements, which gives them the specificity necessary for use in the national context, but limits their comparability between countries.

This mechanism works as follows: a fixed subsidy amount is paid to a private operator for each new water connection installed in a poor neighbourhood. A significant risk with such approach, however, is that the newly connected users might not receive adequate service from the operator after the connection has been installed. To enhance the sustainability of the schemes, a portion of the output-based payment can be withheld until several months of service delivery have been made.

Particularly in the case of the ‘war on terror’, similar concerns and conceptual tools have increasingly surfaced on both sides. Nonetheless, one debate—namely Carl Schmitt's theory of the exception and its uptake in IR—has travelled less well. This article argues that there is value in engaging with the IR debates on the exception. From the perspective of IR, the exception makes possible different insights about the dialectics between law and crime by unpacking the constitutive role of the politics of fear, the importance of the ‘international’ and the transformed relationship to the future. It also exposes the deteriorating effects of the ‘war on terror’ on justice, democracy and social transformation.

Violence against women environmental defenders, often perpetrated by government-backed corporations, remains overlooked.

Through comparative political ecology, this research analyzes cases from the Environmental Justice Atlas, an online open-access inventory of environmental distribution conflicts, in which one or more women were assassinated while fighting a diverse array of extractive and polluting projects. Although the stories showcase a breadth of places, conflicts, social-class backgrounds, and other circumstances between women defenders, most cases featured multinational large-scale extractive companies supported by governments violently targeting women defenders with impunity.

Similarly, a municipality or utility will only be able to finance K-SWM w'hen water savings compensate investment and operating costs, that is, when revenues from water tariffs tend to reflect full water supply costs. This explains why the diffusion of SWM in Korea is directly related to issues discussed in Chapter 3, and to other issues related to tariffs for water supply and sanitation services (an issue not covered in this report).

What followed, however, was considerable judicial reluctance by English courts to remedy this error. The article examines various legislative and judicial approaches from major common law jurisdictions around the world that purport to lessen the potential for injustice created by this judicial caution. Yet despite legislative intervention in England to provide limited remedies, there has been a marked reluctance elsewhere to produce the necessary radical reform suggested by the Law Reform Commission of Ontario. The position in Ireland is examined and the authors note that the time may be ripe for a reconsideration of the current statutory provisions in that jurisdiction.

Both public and private actors have begun to recognize that solving global water challenges is not a solitary endeavour. This process has resulted in notable water savings and pollution reduction, mitigating environmental and social impacts and often reducing water and related costs (i.e., energy, chemicals) to the business. An industrial facility’s exposure to risk thus depends on the ability of public water policy and management to deliver water services, to address water-related risks over the long term, to create effective allocation regimes, and to develop and enforce water quality regulations.

What exactly (and what age) is a child when seen as the subject rather than object of research? How does this affect both methodology and method? Does the special social status of childhood imply new approaches and techniques, different ethical considerations, a novel role for researchers? Who should be a child researcher? What, indeed, are the human rights of children?

The national time-use survey in Mexico collects information on the time spent caring for persons aged 60 or older, including support in the use of information technology, transportation and accompaniment, even when the older person is not dependent or does not have a disability. In households where persons in this age range are present, women spend 18 hours per week on average caring for them, compared with 15 hours spent by men.

The first urgency is always to save lives at sea, and the Italian Mare Nostrum Operation has been a good example, not followed by EU choices. At the moment border surveillance and the fight against trafficking and smuggling of migrants seem to be the priorities in EU policy and action. The EU Dublin System is now facing a huge crisis and the new models, in particular the Statement agreed with Turkey, do not convince from a legal point of view, mainly because refugees deserve a special attention, based on the non-refoulement principle. The time has come to exit the logic of emergency and formulate a lasting policy to manage migrations, implementing Lisbon Treaty and CFR principles based on solidarity and respect of human rights, as well as on true cooperation among States.

Meanwhile, only 68% of the aid to primary education targeted gender equality in Sub-Saharan Africa where, except for some countries in Southern Africa, primary school enrolment had some of the highest levels of gender disparity (see Chapter 4). There is therefore scope for DAC members to increase the gender equality focus of their aid to primary education in Sub-Saharan Africa.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the ratio has flatlined. Thus, the hypothesis of the Kuznets curve is not confirmed in all cases, which suggests that the relationship between pollution and per capita income is less direct than originally thought. An explanation for this is that the two forces defining the curve (structural change and technical change) depend on policies and institutions, whose operation brings progress towards the least polluting stage to a premature halt.

In Korea, the total capacity increased considerably at the end of the 1990s (because of its considerable nuclear programme), but the high economic growth rate led to considerable electricity consumption, resulting in an important decrease of TC/PL in 2000-2007. The electricity generated by nuclear is only slightly sensitive to the variations of the price of uranium, contrary to energy sources burning fossil fuel.

More broadly, policy systems as a whole will require systemic changes to enable the more coherent and more flexible design of integrated policies for climate resilience, with participation from all relevant stakeholders. For many developing countries, these changes will not be possible without global partnerships. Despite overall convergence in average per capita income across countries, within-country inequalities are on the rise. This important trend along with others, such as globalization and technological change, demographic dynamics, rapid urbanization and climate change itself, will exert additional pressures leading towards increasing inequalities both among and within countries. Moreover, if investment in green technologies is inadequate, if population growth continues to be high, if investment in human capital is low and if current socioeconomic inequalities remain, then income poverty and inequality are likely to increase in the future under scenarios where current unmitigated emissions are high.

Like Barkawi and Laffey, I am unpersuaded by the claim that `a global order, a new logic and structure of rule—in short, a new form of sovereignty' has emerged. However, Barkawi and Laffey avoid engaging with the primary theoretical moves enabling this claim. These moves connect a claim about immanence in the philosophical struggles of early-European modernity with a claim about the imminence of a new form of political order arising from a process of internalisation of the interstate system. It is because this relationship is not placed under suspicion that Hardt and Negri over-interpret many important observations within an updated but conventional, and unsatisfactory, account of a universalising history.

Arbitrage links energy market prices with balancing and ancillary services prices and this creates opportunities to change the operations of generating units according to price incentives delivered on these different interrelated power markets. The market for reserves or balancing services may not have any locational dimension. Generation services are much more differentiated than the basic underlying commodity with which they are associated. The system operator may, for example, need generating capacity responding in 10 minutes at a particular node of the network (Joskow, 2007).

Two additional tables in Appendix 4.B report the cost increase per unit of renewable production and the total cost of electricity supply, on an absolute basis (Tables 4.1B and 4.2B respectively). However, introducing large shares of renewable energy with low variable cost has also significant impacts on the optimal structure of the electricity generating mix, on resulting electricity prices and on the profitability of existing dispatchable power plants, which make up the pecuniary externalities referred to in Chapter 1.

Diluting harmful social norms may require - to borrow from an old Persian saying - ‘death by a thousand cuts’, i.e. small or incremental changes being made across multiple fronts, none of which is seen as socially damaging by itself, but which over time leads to the demise of the harmful social norm and its replacement with social norms that enhance women’s and girls’ opportunities, not distract from them. These actions, illustrated in Chapter 6, will need to be carried out across a broad range of social, economic and political arenas where women’s rights are being limited.

These reports have established that there are methods of valuation that are routinely used and well-established, but that the majority of cases where IP valuation is required are not related to finance. Rather, these use cases address the need for values to be determined w'hen assets are bought and sold (usually in conjunction with the enterprise that owns them), transferred to another entity (when the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting work of OECD is of direct relevance) or become the subject of litigation. In addition, evidence suggests that the valuation of intangibles is less common practice for smaller firms than for large companies.

orig_174: Both champions and critics of “neorealism” in contemporary international relations misinterpret David Hume as an early spokesman for a universal and scientific balance-of-power theory. This article instead treats Hume’s “Of the Balance of Power,” alongside the other essays in his Political Discourses (1752), as conceptual resources for a historically inflected analysis of state balancing. Hume’s defense of the balance of power cannot be divorced from his critique of commercial warfare in “Of the Balance of Trade” and “Of the Jealousy of Trade.” To better appreciate Hume’s historical and economic approach to foreign policy, this article places Hume in conversation with Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Andrew Fletcher, and Montesquieu. International relations scholars suspicious of static paradigms should reconsider Hume’s genealogy of the balance of power, which differs from the standard liberal and neorealist accounts. Well before International Political Economy developed as a formal subdiscipline, Hume was conceptually treating economics and power politics in tandem.

The second most important factor leading to increased poverty is health impacts, followed by the impacts of higher temperatures on labour productivity. The shocks impinge on physical capital, when assets are destroyed - for example, through the death of livestock - or when farmers are forced to sell productive capital, such as cattle, to absorb the income shock. They also reduce farmers' capacity to invest, with negative consequences for future food security. Scenarios in which no additional efforts are made to mitigate emissions lead to pathways between RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5.

orig_185: Income-support programmes, in the form of unemployment benefits, social assistance, family benefits or housing allowances, have played an important macroeconomic role as automatic stabilisers during the recent crisis. Many OECD countries face high and often growing needs for social policies at times of shrinking fiscal space, which restrict the capacity for an effective response. In the early phases of the global financial and economic crisis, social spending — which accounts for about half of total public outlays in OECD countries - increased. Moreover, large fiscal stimulus packages were put in place in many countries often including greater resources for social measures. But in many OECD countries, a shift in the fiscal stance is now taking place to tackle unprecedented deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios. Social spending is part of many fiscal consolidation plans, and pressure on social spending is set to increase further.

orig_186: The use of gender statistics can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the gender dimensions of poverty, which in turn can significantly change priorities in policy and programme interventions (Klugman, 2002). Gender statistics can address multiple dimensions of poverty and inequality, including gender-based asset inequality, intrahousehold allocation of resources, time poverty or vulnerability to external shocks. Understanding the gendered nature of poverty will significantly improve both the equity and efficiency of poverty reduction strategies (Klugman, 2002). Gender statistics have an important role in developing and monitoring policies on the reduction of violence against women.

Application rates in the subregion are now widely declining in response to the legal framework summarised above, but the time taken for pollutants to move through the hydrological cycle means that in some areas concentrations in receiving waters may still be rising, even when the source itself is diminishing. Where trend data exists, this suggests that nitrate concentrations declined between 1992 and 2008 in 30% of rivers.

Quality of government is conceptualized in terms of an absence of corruption, a well-established rule of law and bureaucratic efficiency. Based on the cross-country analysis of the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (World Economic Forum, 2013), the main finding of the study demonstrates that quality of government is positively associated with tourism competitiveness and that this positive effect remains robust across a number of control variables and estimation techniques. The results suggest that public policy for building a successful tourism industry should be nested in the broader project of enhancing the quality of government.

orig_191: Qualitative research dominates political science. In the field of international relations (IR), for example, about 70% of scholars primarily employ qualitative methods, compared to 21% favoring formal or quantitative analysis (Jordan et al.  2009 ). Since nearly all of the latter make secondary use of textual and historical methods, overall  over 90% of IR scholars  employ qualitative analysis, whereas 48% use any statistical and only 12% any formal methods. This understates the dominance of qualitative analysis, for many statistical data sets rest ultimately on historical work, and IR scholars, when polled, report that qualitative case studies are more relevant for policy than quantitative or formal work. Hardly any major IR debate—whether that over the end of the cold war, American unipolarity, Chinese foreign policy, the nature of European integration, compliance with international law, democratic peace, the causes of war, or the impact of human rights norms—remains untouched by important qualitative contributions.

While in most countries appraisal is based on the interaction between evaluators and school leaders, e.g. through interviews, meetings and school visits, a few countries complement the information gathered this way with further, more outcomes-oriented data, such as leadership portfolios, stakeholder surveys and information on student achievement. Depending on the policy framework for appraisal and the overall allocation of responsibilities, evaluators and school leaders themselves hold greater or lesser autonomy in determining the tools to collect information.

The priority is the security of information systems and networks, rather than the protection of connected users. The dominance of war metaphors in the cyber security debates has produced a security dilemma, which is not sufficiently addressing the needs of people. This article underlines this shortcoming and views cyber security through a human-centric perspective.

From a human-centric perspective such rights should be understood as a critical part of cyber security.

Their research addresses issues of gender, education and a changing labour market and work life and how these issues impact young adults as regards their choice of education and mobility patterns. The men of Northern Norway are, however, mainly employed within building and construction. Aure particularly emphasises that despite the lack of a highly educated labour force, it may be difficult to find acceptance in the local communities of Norway. Munkejord (2006) also focuses on Norwegians from other parts of the country choosing to reside in Northern Norway and seeks to form an understanding of their motivations behind moving and in particular their motivations behind settling in the peripheral areas as opposed to in the larger cities in the southern part of Norway.

There is still a significant gap between 2030 emission levels and a least-cost 2°C pathway amounting to 11 GtC02e or even as much as i3.5GtC02e, taking only unconditional NDCs into account (UNEP 2017). Global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate, and even though the Parties must increase the goals of their NDCs overtime, it is unlikely that the emissions reductions thus achieved will be sufficient (UNEP 2017).

A robust estimation of finance needs requires deep understanding and analysis of the specific policy and market context, in particular on barriers to the implementation of climate compatible alternative technologies or processes, and the elaboration of corresponding and sound investment plans.

orig_204: The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’) is an impressive document. It lists numerous fundamental rights and freedoms in a clear and ‘robust’ way. It brings together for the first time, in a single document, classical human rights, social and economic rights, as well as rights and freedoms already known from the EC/EU Treaties (free movement, non-discrimination, EU citizenship rights, etc.). These rights are, moreover, classified and organized in a new and quite original fashion – six Chapters, dealing with Dignity, Freedoms, Equality, Solidarity, Citizens’ Rights, Justice. Limitations and exceptions to the rights and freedoms set out in these first six parts of the Charter are almost non-existent. The claim that the Charter indeed makes fundamental rights more ‘visible’ to the citizens of the Union (after enlargement to the East some 480 million people) is thus not without foundation.

Take, for example, the Americas, where three distinct types of colonies took shape in the 1700s, depending on the initial conditions of soil, climate and native inhabitancy. The distribution of wealth and human capital was extremely unequal, advantaging the elite who could assemble large companies of slaves.

In contrast, the focus of this study is specifically on the philosophical foundations of authentic leadership and their implications for leadership practice and continuing professional development. It emphasises the contribution of virtue ethics by identifying key moral and intellectual virtues associated with authenticity and how they can provide an ethical framework for action guidance in the school leadership context. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research based on more interdisciplinary and international comparative studies, especially in non-Western societies and cultural contexts, both to deepen and broaden our understanding of authentic-ethical leadership and its impact.

The increased labour-market flexibility promoted in most countries under the development model adopted in the 1980s failed to lead to faster growth in labour demand, rather, it introduced job insecurity for a high proportion of workers. Moreover, in conjunction with the increasing instability of employment, social benefits tended to be linked to employment contracts. Thus, the relatively unproductive and uncompetitive informal sector persisted, and many workers moved towards own-account work characterized by low income levels, lack of regulation and exclusion from social protection systems, in particular from social security and health care.

In Kazakhstan, the disparities in regional development are the basis of the unequal revenue position of local budgets and thus determine the essential role of interbudget relations, such as subsidies and earmark transfers. Transfers to SNGs thus include funds from the equalisation of oblasts' tax revenues to reduce disparities. On the whole, general (non-earmarked) budget transfers are based on a complex system of formulas that tries to capture the difference in the cost of providing public services in each oblast, district or city.

Since the correlation between multidimensional deprivation and GDP per capita has been found to be only moderately strong (see Figure 13) the regression has been made more robust by including various control variables. The regression is weighted by the countries' population size. In other words, 63.6%, or just below 300 million children in the 45 countries of sub-Saharan Africa are multidimensionally poor, being deprived in two to five dimensions of basic child rights out of a total of five dimensions analysed per child. Among the children in the 28 selected countries (361 million children in total), 181 million children (50%) are living below the extreme poverty line of $1.25 a day, and 244 million children (67.5%) are multidimensionally deprived.

But its provision dramatically increases both economic productivity and quality of life. In rural areas, access to affordable energy can boost farm productivity because of its uses in pumping water for irrigation, mechanization, agricultural processing and post-harvest storage. Developing a domestic eneigy industry has multiple benefits, because of jobs created in system maintenance and repairs, billing and administration, and power plant operation and distribution, in addition to backward linkages and new domestic markets (UNCTAD, 2017). Positive feedback effects are created as energy provision supports transportation and information and communication technologies (ICTs), which in turn assist in eneigy generation and distribution. The design of transportation systems shapes social transformations, and how populations and businesses settle and interact (NCE, 2014, Atack et al.,

Using a content analysis of the CSR reports of US and European firms, we show that firms from the coordinated market economies (CME) of Europe engage more substantively with labour and human rights than their US counterparts that operate in a liberal market economy (LME). The environmental commitments of firms in both regions, however, are more developed than practices related to these social issues. These findings support the view that CSR is more developed in CMEs than LMEs, but limit this support to social CSR issues. We posit that firms’ higher levels of engagement with environmental CSR likely reflect the extent to which environmental norms have become embedded in global markets rather than how CSR is promoted by national capitalist systems.

In France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmaik, Austria, Hungary and Romania, damages to crop increase at a decelerating pace as drought severity increases. Interestingly, historical data show that crop production in Finland and Norway actually increases with drought severity. The dynamic of water risks determines the potential irreversibility of their impacts and the possible responses from the sector.

These teacher teams were often in charge of school development in general and supported the school leader in implementing policy changes. One school leader explained the importance of giving teachers good explanations of why the school needed to work on AfL, before explaining how he had used policy documents and research articles as evidence for why this was important. He emphasized the importance of treating teachers with respect since they are highly educated and will not do something just because the Minister has introduced a new programme. Overall, the school leaders described practices that emphasized participation, sharing responsibility and cooperation. These structures can be seen as signs of successful implementation strategies, and some of the schools visited were able to build a sustainable environment for AfL practice through these networks.

The more time people spend at work, the less they have for other activities, such as family responsibilities and rest. Reductions in working hours —one of the most common demands from workers' movements for much of the twentieth century— have been made with a view to safeguarding workers' physical and mental health.

orig_242: For instance, the coefficient of -0.03 in 2012 (Model 1 in Table A5) means that the difference of lOppt in the MIP indicator (say, between Belgium (50%) and the Czech Republic (40%) in 2011) is associated with 35% greater odds of a child being poor in 2012, all else being equal.28 Using the coefficients from the model, Figure A3 in the Annex shows a steady decrease in the predicted probability of a child being poor across the range of values of the MIP indicator. Thus, children in countries with more generous minimum income protection schemes are less likely to be poor during the crisis, but the generosity of social assistance could be picking up the effect of the overall size of the welfare state. When social spending is entered in the model, the MIP effect becomes smaller and less precisely estimated, remaining significant only in 2009 and 2012 (model 2 Table A5).

But energy markets are far from perfect, and this is especially true of markets in technological and structural transition, such as the RE market. Thus, as a result of insufficient information, underlying project risk can tend to be overrated and transaction costs can increase as compared to conventional fossil fuel technologies. Often, the viability of a specific investment is dependent upon a particular policy regime remaining in place, and this is a major risk that equity and debt (banks) investors will need to evaluate before deciding on the financing parameters for the project.

Hence, there are currently limited opportunities of relating the distribution of forest biodiversity to carbon stocks via specific variation in forest environmental properties. The relevant data should exist in national forest inventories and could be related to relevant environmental properties, but as far as we know such analyses are mostly lacking and only rather coarse relationships can be described at the Nordic level (cf chapters 5 and 6.1).

orig_254: Explicitly incorporating women's traditional work in agriculture, for example, in seed selection and preservation to maintain crop biodiversity, is important in these analyses. Moreover, gender inequality in land rights and access to resources, as well as in the burden of unpaid care work, poses substantial barriers to greening agriculture in sustainable and pro-poor ways (Herren and others, 2012). These include energy, construction, transportation and, among basic industries, aluminium, iron and steel (ILO, 2012). In manufacturing, the emphasis is on introducing clean processing techniques and controlling pollution, with less of an apparent total employment effect (International Labour Foundation for Sustainable Development, 2009).

An interesting finding of the researches in the United Kingdom (Dhaliwal, 1998 and 2007, Ram and Jones, 1998) is that Asian women are not strongly represented in self-employment because there is a tendency for some women entrepreneurs to be “invisible” and their existence unacknowledged. These “hidden” women (Dhaliwal, 1998) say it is their husband, father or brother who run the business and they are masking the extent of their role even if they are playing a pivotal role in the management of the business.

orig_257: At the class or school level, however, weaker or disadvantaged students are often intentionally grouped and placed in smaller classes so that they receive more individual attention. At the school level, therefore, the observed relationship between class size and student achievement is often positive, suggesting that students in larger classes perform better than students in smaller classes. At higher levels of aggregation, the relationship between student achievement and class size is further confounded, by the socio-economic intake of individual schools or by factors relating to the learning culture in different countries. Therefore, to interpret the indicators, it is important to fully understand the relationships between them.

orig_258: In this article I argue that disabled people in the United Kingdom have been tipped into an abyss of counterfeit citizenship. They have been smeared as ‘false mendicants’ – an old trick well documented in the historical archives of ableism. Neoliberalism has used this repertoire of invalidation – its noxious taint of cunning and fraud – as the ‘moral justification’ for welfare reform and for the pillory and notoriety into which the entire disabled community has been placed. Austerity – through the neoliberal politics of resentment – has made disabled people its scapegoat. I argue that a historical precedent for the contemporary demonisation of disabled people as counterfeit citizens can be found in the early modern period in the mythology of the ‘sturdy beggar’.

It would also ensure that investment plans better reflect basin priorities and that public expenditures across sectors are better aligned with water policy objectives. The potential for policy coherence at the watershed level could be improved through the systematic involvement of river basin organisations and councils, this is an area that needs to be further exploited. In particular, the Agenda foresees the creation of a Ministry of Land Use Planning for a long-term land-use planning strategy, a National Observatory of Sustainable Land Use Planning, and a National Development Planning Institute to ensure the long-term harmonisation among different sectoral and territorial development policies in Mexico. Such tools would help move from traditional ad hoc bilateral discussions between CONAGUA and other agencies (CONAFOR, SEDESOL, SAGARPA, etc.) The current institutional set-up for dealing with climate change issues might serve as an example to mobilise key institutions of the federal public administration towards policy coherence (see Box 1.10).

It is true that, if stakeholders participate actively, the nexus dialogue may uncover important sectoral perspectives that can serve as good bases for solutions. In the Alazani/Ganykh assessment, for instance, the topic of forest degradation would not have emerged without the sectoral phases having taken place.

orig_268: Sometimes secrecy in law is required to protect vulnerable witnesses or suppress sensitive evidence. However, particularly since the terror attacks of 11 September 2001, governments in liberal democratic societies have increased secrecy and the use of clandestine procedures under the pretext of safeguarding national security. In many instances, these developments have eroded civil liberties, infringed upon constitutional guarantees, and had negative effects on due process rights. In Australia, where individual rights and freedoms have only limited constitutional expression, it is hoped the doctrine of representative and responsible government will act as sufficient protection for human rights. Conversely, drawing on examples ranging from the regulation of immigration to the control of serious organised crime, this article proposes that escalating secrecy in the current era has a corrupting effect on democratic principles and the rule of law.

As a result, even the high rate of growth in China, if not accompanied by structural and other changes ensuring more job creation, cannot meet the pressure for jobs. For example, in 2003, with a 9.1 per cent aggregate GDP growth rate, 8 million jobs were created, but even this was inadequate given the continuously growing “backlog” of labour force increases and reduced demand for labour in many traditional activities including agriculture.

However, more recently, the share of its total public investment devoted to transport infrastructure decreased from 8.2% to 6.6% between 2006 and 2015. Railways - and especially high-speed railways - have also gradually surfaced back as an alternative response to car-centred development and to the side effects of the latter, such as congestion and environmental degradation.4 The high-speed Korea Train eXpress (KTX), first inaugurated in 2004, handled 42.3% of total rail traffic in 2010.

Both are produced by development models that support particular types of underregulated market-led growth and the persistence of unequal power relations between women and men (Wichterich, 2012).

This effect remains and grows stronger over the medium term, since the lagged feminization variable for one period has an effect equivalent to 7.7% on the growth rate. This is considered to be a robust result given the stability of both the coefficient and the standard error in all three specifications. This provides a partial confirmation of the hypothesis that, in the presence of a pre-existing gap in labour force participation, women's entry into the workforce can help fuel growth or a recovery if an economy is in a recession or when its existing capacity is being underutilized.

The present study is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview, but instead report on key figures to provide a broad view of the current situation. Despite still lagging far below the levels needed to limit warming to two degrees Celsius,5 climate finance flows have increased when compared to the 2013 level of $331 billion. In 2013, climate finance flows were directed almost equally to developed (OECD) and developing (non-OECD) countries, with each group receiving $164 billion and $165 billion, respectively (Buchner and others, 2014). North-South flows accounted for $34 billion in 2012 (Buchner and others, 2014). Developing countries invested $2 billion in developed countries and $10 billion in South-South cooperation (Buchner and others, 2014).

The models of collegiate decision  seriatim ,  per curiam  and  majoritariam practice  are analyzed, concluding that the latter is more appropriate to the Brazilian courts. The purpose of the article is to demonstrate that if the is not adapted to the aforementioned model, the deliberative procedure of the courts will result in inefficiency of this system of precedents. The method adopted is hypothetical-deductive, through a critical analysis of the need for improvement of the creation and respect of precedents.

Consecutive waves of devolution have decentralized the Danish welfare state, and the power of local governments is now being challenged by the emergence of new forms of local governance that involve a plethora of private stakeholders, such as business firms, interest organizations, community groups and individual citizens, in the formulation and implementation of public policy. This article argues that participation of private stakeholders in public policy‐making cannot be reduced to an inferior supplement to traditional forms of representative democracy.

The fragmented nature of water law mainly originates from the fact that water can be seen as an economic, ecological and social unit (horizontal fragmentation). Within the clusters that these units constitute, water law is also seen as fragmented, given that a particular cluster is composed of different levels (vertical fragmentation). This article will scrutinise the social justice cluster, or the right to water, and examine whether and to what extent vertical fragmentation in water law leads to divergent approaches among the different levels, while placing the discussion within the general context of fragmentation in international law. For that purpose the elaboration of the human right to water by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, functioning at the international level, will be compared with the practice of the European Court of Human Rights (ECTHR), a regional court.

orig_282: This paper examines how the decentralization of state power and, advent of mayoral elections in Bogota, Colombia, enabled municipal government, with the help of a cadre of professional planners and designers, to transform the city socially and physically by reinventing civil society and public space. Three contiguous mayoral administrations used public space as a setting and tool to reinvent a culture of citizenship as well as to demonstrate competency on behalf of the mayors. The mayors’ strategy was largely successful as Bogota has experienced a move from individualism to collective spirit, and citizens report improvements in civility, friendliness and quality of life. Much of the city's success derives from the vision of the mayors and the important role urban planners and designers provide in implementing that vision. By examining Bogota's transformation, it is possible to better understand how local politicians and planning and design administrators are key to that change.

However, trade secret law was dramatically transformed by the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which has been enacted in forty-seven states. Although now statutory law, the law of trade secrets retains the basic character of its common law roots, often relying without significant elaboration on concepts developed through common law adjudication. Harvey Perlman and I were the Reporters for the American Law Institute’s Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, which includes an analysis of trade secret law applicable to actions under the Uniform Act. The trade secret sections of the Restatement do not of course substitute for the statutory text, but they can be helpful aids in interpreting the statute. This article examines the changes in trade secret law made by the Uniform Act as analyzed in the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition.

Although no statistical relationship can be established, this may suggest that emerging economies might experiment higher levels of consumption as their revenue increases. To better understand the drivers of the level of alcohol consumption over time, extensions for further analysis could explore the effects of macro-level factors, including economic as well as environmental indicators. Social patterns of drinking tend to differ across countries, as they are largely the result of cultural and environmental influences, and of government policies in place in the countries concerned.

It is essential to develop and implement public policies on the redistribution of time and work to foster gender equality and sustainable development (ECLAC, 2016a). Significant measures have been taken to address each of these commitments, especially over the past 10 years: developing time-use measurement tools, quantifying unpaid domestic work and unpaid care work, and promoting satellite accounts that allow the value of this type of work to be included in national accounts. Time-use data analyses have been very useful in the development of public policies targeting the recognition and redistribution of unpaid work, which represent one of the main determining factors of inequality between men and women in the region, even more so when other determinants of time distribution are taken into account, such as a person's place of residence, ethnicity, race and age, from an intersectional perspective."

The article mainly relies on primary sources such as newspapers, governmental and non-governmental reports and a comparative literature survey. We argue that decentralized local governance in Malawi has enhanced corruption among the local assemblies in relation to their election, awarding of contracts and other related acts. This has consequently led to, inter alia, financial mess in local assemblies, loss of citizen and donor trust as well as low-quality infrastructures. Meanwhile, the democracy and good governance that were envisaged in the creation of local assemblies through the Local Government Act 1998 and the Malawian constitution have seriously been undermined.

In addition, many contend that what is known as the ASEAN process not only has transformed Southeast Asia's international relations, but has started to build a shared East Asian regional identity. ASEAN's deeper integration into a security, economic, and political community, as well as its extension into the ASEAN Plus Three processes that were begun after the 1997 financial crisis, offers a test case of the dominant assumptions in both ASEAN scholarship and liberal and idealist accounts of international relations theory. Three case studies of ASEAN operating as an economic and security community demonstrate, however, that the norms and practices that ASEAN promotes, rather than creating an integrated community, can only sustain a pattern of limited intergovernmental and bureaucratically rigid interaction.

As part of the conditions mandated for European Union (EU) accession, Romania has been urged to demonstrate movement toward greater rule of law (Romania, 2008). One way in which Romania has responded to this objective is through the creation of the Superior Council of the Magistracy (CSM), a judicial body separate from the executive branch. Additionally, changes are occurring to the Romanian judiciary as a result of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) power to remand cases that are inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights (Janis, 2000). This qualitative research involved an attitudinal study based on semi-structured interviews of members of the Romanian judiciary.

orig_304: The Arctic regions of the United States (Alaska) and Canada (Northern Canada) have the highest levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on earth. The toxic health-threatening substances are transported over long distances by rivers, oceans and air currents from warmer parts of the world to the colder polar regions. They also accumulate in the fatty tissue of seals and whales which traditionally play a key role in Arctic indigenous peoples' diet and can be passed directly to infants through maternal breast milk, causing disruption of the hormone and immune systems and affecting postnatal growth. Disease patterns among American Indians and Alaska Natives are strongly associated with the adverse consequences of poverty, limited access to health services, and cultural dislocation. Inadequate education, high rates of unemployment, discrimination, and cultural differences all contribute to unhealthy lifestyles and disparities in access to health care for many indigenous peoples.

The crucial question nevertheless is whether there are adequate laws to deal with key maritime crimes that need effective law enforcement measures. The paper finds that no maritime offences are criminalised in the Penal Code, the principal criminal law of Malaysia and that there is neither an anti-piracy law nor any other special criminal law available in Malaysia to combat maritime crimes. A regretful failure to apply a more appropriate law to prosecute Somali pirates demonstrates well an urgent need in Malaysia for a law reform that can effectively combat maritime crimes. On the basis of an analysis of the laws of selected common law countries, the paper concludes with suggestions on proposed maritime crimes law to be recommended to the Government of Malaysia.

Our hypothesis is that international law, in the form of treaties, has been reluctant to engage with national security when dealing with migration, leaving this to national law. Instead, the intersection of national security—most commonly in the form of concerns about terrorism and migration—takes place in political discourse, which acts as a passerelle for various types of state violence against people classified or suspected of being migrants. We examine this mechanism that we call an insecurity continuum driven by the politics of fear in a European context.

It has to be decided how to adapt infrastructure so that these vehicles can be used under conditions of appropriate safety, both for the users, if they have to share space with cars, and for pedestrians and/or bicyclists, when they have to share the space with them. The international databases that contain crash data of several European countries do usually not include data on fatalities per means of transport per age-group.

Schools are therefore typically responsible for decisions directly related to the implementation of the school project, such as class size (within the regulated minimum and maximum size), student grouping, support for students with learning difficulties, school leadership arrangements, and the use of school facilities. In addition, school providers may delegate further tasks and responsibilities to schools, while retaining the final overall responsibility for the operation of their schools. For example, schools may make suggestions for staffing decisions, but the school provider will take the final decision.

Gaining a better understanding of where and how' students are starting to fall behind would enable the development of more effective supports to teachers and schools. Recognising the importance of consolidating basic skills in the early grades for later learning, many OECD countries have introduced a national assessment in the second (e.g. France, Italy), third (e.g. Germany, Sweden), or fourth grade (e.g. Chile, Korea) of primary school (OECD, 2013). One essential improvement at any grade in Costa Rica is better information on the equity of outcomes.

Gislason blames the unsuccessful attempts to change the educational choices of Icelandic men on the fact that prior to the economic crisis in 2008, Iceland had no considerable unemployment. Some jobs, such as those within health care, are now considered to be more ""secure"" and less vulnerable to cyclical fluctuations, Gislason therefore believes, that the crisis might be instrumental in breaking with the traditional gender segregation of the Icelandic labour market. The Icelandic labour market is also characterised by unequal pay, and this is related to place: Icelandic women are paid less than Icelandic men, and this applies to married women in particular (according to figures from Centre for Gender Equality, 2014) (see also Rafnsdottir and Omarsdottir 2010)."

In line with this result, the educational attainment gap (the ratio between the educational attainment of the male and female EAP) displays significant negative coefficients for the lagged variable (22%), while the contemporaneous variable is not significant. According to the existing literature on returns to education for men and women in the region, the relationship between educational attainment and wage levels is stronger for women than it is for men. Thus the elimination of these gaps could lead to higher wages and greater participation on the part of women, which could in turn have an impact on demand-led growth in the future. Since 2003, employment surveys in that country have included a battery of questions on time use.

The impact of the ICT sector on economic and societal development continues to expand as companies from adjacent sectors and industries (including the automotive, healthcare, insurance, banking and public sectors) develop products and services that rely on loT infrastructure - leaving virtually no areas of our economies and societies untouched. Industry analysts estimate that loT revenues will generate USD 1.1 trillion in revenues globally by 2025, compared to USD 166 billion in 2016 (GSMA, 2018d). This revenue opportunity is expected to be fuelled over the next three years by investments of around USD 15 billion in IT consulting and systems integration services to build and implement loT solutions (IDC, 2018).

In this case, a dollar of input subsidies would result in a cost reduction for farm inputs of only 0.42 dollars (Figure 22). This is partly caused by the fact that relative to the fertiliser price, a given subsidy value is smaller under imperfect competition as the price includes the producers’ mark-up and is hence higher than under perfect competition.

Incentives created by policy frameworks include infrastructure mapping initiatives as well as relevant directives such as the Cost Reduction Directive in the European Union.

The schools have acquired relatively great autonomy: all of them now have an elected school board with relatively strong jurisdictions, they are protected from too strong a local control through the funding system (which limits the redistributing power of their founders), they take responsibility for human resource management, and they are also encouraged to adapt the national curriculum to their own specific educational context through school education programmes. At the same time the national Ministry maintains strong regulatory powers. The move towards extended local and institutional autonomy has been paralleled with the creation and strengthening of accountability frameworks. The emerging national system of standardised student achievement measurement and the State Schools Inspectorate are key elements of the latter. In addition, the Slovak Republic has an information system which allows the monitoring of many local and institutional level processes (such as student performance, funding and human resource management) and creates opportunities to assess the impact of national policies and development interventions.

Public international law is traditionally focused on the rights and obligations of states, and thus is not particularly well suited to this task. It has adapted through a long and slow historical process, drawing upon multiple sources. Many of the chapters in this Handbook explore to some extent the historical development of international criminal law. I will not attempt to summarize that history in detail, but a few historical observations here will help to explain how international criminal law emerged from its sources in public international law, comparative law, international humanitarian law and international human rights law. This will set the stage for an introductory discussion of some key issues in contemporary international criminal law.

In particular, fisheries rebuilding has been the subject of several major international commitments on developing sustainable fisheries and it is universally recognized as necessary for protecting biodiversity and the health of oceans, as well being important from an economic and social perspective for many coastal communities. As such, while it is universally recognized that rebuilding and maintaining robust fisheries are desired, there are other factors considered in the management process in addition to the science advice. To that end, political commitments have been made through a series of hard (binding) and soft laws (non binding).

This involves a hierarchy of spatial (territorial) plans developed at national, oblast and local levels in accordance with the Main Directions of the State Urban Development Policy for 2011— 2015 and environmental requirements.

Keeping the energy market competitive and ensuring that the needs of end-users are met also requires careful regulation and oversight of the sector, both by a competition authority and a sector-specific regulator.

Loose monetary policies of the developed world, most notably quantitative easing (QE) in the United States, along with the unwillingness of governments to regulate participants in commodity markets, have continued to draw excess funds to the commodities markets due to the markets’ comparatively high expected returns. The presence of financial investors, betting on an increase in fundamental prices due to supply shortages, serves to exaggerate price increases.

While chemical fertiliser can replace nutrient losses the presence of organic matter provides better physical characteristics and as well as micro-nutrients that can affect plant growth. While no-till and conservation till systems require the purchase of synthetic herbicides to be effective the initial cost of herbicides is offset by higher yields and improved soil quality.

In 2015, federal backing focused particularly on high-quality all-day care (the Kita Plus programme). Yet the bulk of ECEC costs remain the responsibility of local jurisdictions w'hich, in 2010, shouldered over two-thirds of all expenditure, while the regional governments covered most of the rest (ESSPROSS, 2010). The cost of child care for German parents is below the OECD average (see below' on child care costs in international comparison), while, in all age groups, supply continues to fall short of demand - in 2014, 32.3% of under-3s years were offered a place, while 41.5% of parents requested one (BMFSFJ, 2015a). Parents are also making increasing use of longer child care hours per week: in 2006 only a quarter of children between 3 and 6 years old were enrolled full-time (at least seven continuous hours per day) in ECEC, while the figure in 2013 was 42% (DIPF, 2014: 55). Clearly, then, German parents have benefitted from a major expansion in ECEC for young children in recent years.

orig_385: Europe’s poorer regions tend to receive most support, although all European regions are eligible for funding under the policy’s various funds. The Structural Funds invoice a “performance reserve”, an inventive mechanism intended to encourage performance improvement by attaching explicit financial incentives to indicators and targets. The mechanism was implemented in a broader context of monitoring and evaluation activities by the EU that included a mid-term evaluation process. The reserve set aside 4% of a programme’s total budget and distributed it only if specific objectives were achieved. In consultation with the European Commission, member countries selected their own indicators, chose their own approach to assessment, and each used the mechanism differently.

Among the major issues discussed were: (a) prevention, investigation and prosecution of microtrafficking and its links to transnational criminal networks, (b) border management, (c) ways to address current trends in trafficking in cocaine, and (d) curbing access to the supply of precursor chemicals. Possession for personal use will be treated as an administrative offence, similar to a traffic violation, with a 30-day period to pay the administrative fine. The amendment also allows each household to cultivate up to five cannabis plants.

orig_387: In this regard, it should be kept in mind that land use planning policies aiming at rather compact cities are those, which would enable and result in a high-occupancy public transport service®. In this context, establishment of effective and efficient urban transport system requires that the necessary infrastructure, including for the various public transport modes, be built so that it is reasonably resistant to the effects of extreme weather events caused by climate change. Resilient means that negative consequences of an extreme weather event can be easily restored. Compartmentalizing is about making compartments so that an infrastructure failure can be limited to a certain area.

It should be emphasised that with hyperinflation and rapid change in the product mix, all macroeconomic data up to 1995 must be treated with caution. The targets for 2015 include the following: 80% of construction materials to be provided by building materials produced in Kazakhstan, domestic oil refineries will satisfy the country’s fuel requirements, exports of metallurgical goods will double, and production of chemical goods will triple from 2009 levels.

We shall see, but no doubt this is what politics and social straggles will be all about in the years to come. The ability to cope with adverse shocks is compromised by the lack of formal social protection, and vulnerabilities are compounded when individuals working informally face harassment by public authorities.

The results are also summarised in Table 2.24 and are broadly in agreement with those obtained by Jandosov and Sabyrova, although a direct comparison of the results from the two studies requires caution due to differences in the computations (e.g. slightly different trade periods used for weighting the tariffs).

The socially constructed differences between men and women are an important dimension of inequality and exclusion and must be tackled to achieve the SDGs. More than 60 percent of undernourished or chronically hungry people in the world live in the Asia-Pacific region. In rural and urban areas, seasonal variability, which pushes up the price of staples, forces households to spend more of their income on food.

Efforts to improve the provision of business development services are hampered by the large number of businesses operating in the informal economy. Female business owners in the informal economy only have limited access to formal support providers such as women's enterprise centres, women's business resource centres and business incubators. In addition, fewer than 5% of MENA adults are exposed to entrepreneurship content in the education system and fewer than 14% after formal education (IDRC 2010). The implication is that the low percentage of MENA women who are starting businesses (relative to the average in GEM economies) are doing it without the benefit of entrepreneurship training, information, and professional advice that would increase their know-how.

orig_394: These OECD-average elasticities are then applied to the country-specific changes in harmonised unemployment and output gap that were observed between 2007 and 2009. The unweighted OECD-average spending prediction based on observed declines in the output gap is just over 1% of GDP higher than actual spending. This historically low responsiveness of social spending to falling output could be sizeable enough to have weakened the automatic stabilisation effect from social spending during the 2008-09 recession, but any such effect may have been offset by the large discretionary fiscal stimulus enacted by many governments.

In beneficiary households belonging to the poorest quintile, the MB accounts for just 7 per cent of total consumption representing the inadequacy of the benefit value.26 It is no surprise therefore that the poverty reduction impact of the MB is limited. Low coverage and low transfer values limit the effectiveness of the benefit. Coverage is extremely low and more than 80 per cent of the poorest are excluded from the targeted MB.

orig_398: Events such as the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Syria have created an urgent need for the international community to engage with a range of armed groups during and after conflict. This engagement extends beyond humanitarian, conflict resolution and counter-terrorism ends to issues of democratization and political transition of such groups in legitimate, stable, and inclusive governments. This article underlines the need to reconsider post-counter-terrorism engagement styles, which frame non-state armed groups (NSAGs) exclusively as spoilers, and stresses opportunities for state-building partnership that certain NSAGs offer. Towards this end, this article emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between different types of NSAGs, based on their sources of legitimacy, resources, reliability, and partnering potential. It concludes with four entry points that promise a strong basis for incorporating ‘legitimacy, inclusion, and resource’ considerations into the planning and implementation of fut...

This rapidly evolving context has important implications for governance of the sector, potentially raising questions as to whether current sectoral governance arrangements remain fit for purpose (Scott, 2015). The principal pathways are outlined in figure 4.6. Planning is particularly important for electricity systems because of the mismatch between the time required to build distribution networks and that required to build generation facilities, highlighting the need for coordination of planning processes for generation and transmission (Chattopadhyay et al.,"

orig_401: This is largely due to, firstly, the fact that social protection in the Pacific is relatively a new field of government activity (WB, 2006a). Secondly, the formal social security system offers low coverage and the vast majority of informal sector employment is not covered under any social security measures. Thirdly, most of PICs are witnessing slow economic growth and have low social protection spending. Finally, since family, community and the traditional support systems still remain stronger, although declining, governments rely heavily upon them for social welfare services.

orig_402: Globalisation has increased the global supply of low-skilled labour, affecting wages and employment prospects of workers with low qualifications. At the same time, more intense international competition for high-skilled workers has pushed up top incomes. Advances in information and communication technology (ICT) are also favouring high-skilled workers, whose task cannot be easily automated, and thereby increasing inequality (Kierzenkowski and Koske 2012). Some studies suggested technological change is a more powerful driver of inequality than globalisation (IMF, 2007, OECD, 2007a).

orig_405: In addition, even in existing national legislation, the role dedicated to LGUs is often unclear and not well supported: despite the existence of the Clean Water Act (2004) and a national law for Risk Management and Climate Change Adaptation, which are supposed to be mainstreamed into local plans, there is no effective implementation of the prescribed policies on the ground in Cebu, due to the lack of details on subnational responsibilities and resources. The creation of national policy frameworks would help to clarify responsibilities, especially for LGUs, while giving them appropriate resources. The Local Government Code of 1991 put LGUs in charge of the provision of basic services, including agriculture (power to reclassify agricultural land), health, social services, public works (enforcement of the National Building Code, power to close and open roads), and environment and natural resources.

orig_406: The larger imbalance may be partly due to the lower level of policy development on adaptation in many of the EECCA countries (see also Chapter 3), but also to the high investment needs for mitigation in the region’s energy sector. In addition, none of the 11 EECCA countries falls under the category Least Developed Countries or Small Island Developing States, which often have greater adaptation needs. Finally, it is generally more difficult to track finance for adaptation since it tends to be embedded into broader development projects and/or business operations, and thus, may be underestimated (CPI and OECD, 2015).

orig_412: Each will now be briefly summarised since they provide some insights into the influence of policy settings on the degree of hysteresis affecting labour input. In the first step, historical data are used to estimate simple dynamic regressions relating the level of long-term unemployment to the contemporaneous (overall) unemployment rate and first and second lags of both unemployment variables (i.e. the overall and long-term unemployment rates). These equations - which are estimated on a country-by-country basis to make allowance for differences across national labour markets in the extent to which a sustained increase in overall unemployment raises long-term unemployment - are then used to translate projected changes in the unemployment rate into projections of long-term unemployment. The second step is to convert the projected changes in long-term unemployment into changes in structural unemployment.
